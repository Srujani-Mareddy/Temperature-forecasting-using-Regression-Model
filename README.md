# Bias Correction of Numerical Prediction Model Temperature Forecast

This repository contains the code and resources for a project focused on bias correction of numerical prediction model temperature forecast data. The dataset used in this project can be found [here](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bias+correction+of+numerical+prediction+model+temperature+forecast). Additionally, you can download the dataset in CSV format from the [Data Folder](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bias+correction+of+numerical+prediction+model+temperature+forecast#).

## Project Overview

The dataset consists of 7750 observations and 25 attributes. The goal is to build models to predict the 'Next Tmax' attribute, which represents the maximum temperature forecasted by the numerical prediction model.

## Repository Structure

- **code/**: Contains the source code for the bias correction models.
- **data/**: Includes the dataset in CSV format.
